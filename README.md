### Firebase Node
Inside the Firebase Node directory we can find one folder which contains the Firebase Cloud functions Project to deploy to the server.

There are 2 functions available for this project, being both of them written in Typescript and are available on the index.js file located at 
```
firebase_node/typescript_clone_images_proj/functions/src
```
The following is a brief description of both of these functions:
+ __sendNotification:__ is a function responsible for sending notifications to every member of the chat, with the exception of the sender of the message. This is triggered everytime there is an update of the message group on the realtime database and it sends a notification whenever it is necessary (new messages sent, additions and removal of users).
+ __resizeImages:__ is a function responsible for cloning the images stored on the Firebase Storage but with a lower resolution. This will verify if the just uploaded image by the user has an adequate size (width+height) and will create a resize version for the high and low resolutions if those are smaller than the original one.

The libraries/frameworks used were the __firebase-functions__ and __firebase-admin__, as well as __sharp__ for the image resizing and __fs-extra__ for folder and file manipulation.
